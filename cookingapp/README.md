# README for CookingApp Framework

This folder provides a starting framework for the CookingApp, modeled after the pantryapp structure.

## Structure
- `cooking_app.py`: Main entry point for the CookingApp GUI.
- `cooking_model.py`: Contains model/data logic (e.g., RecipeManager).
- `gui_windows.py`: Contains Tkinter-based GUI windows (e.g., RecipeDetailsWindow, RecipeListWindow).
- `__init__.py`: Marks this directory as a Python package.

## Getting Started
- Add your recipe, meal, and cooking logic to `cooking_model.py`.
- Build out GUI windows in `gui_windows.py`.
- Launch the app from `cooking_app.py`.

This framework is designed to be extended in a similar style to pantryapp.
